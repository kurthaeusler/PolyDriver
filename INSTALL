The PolyTrax driver for linux is kept as simple and as general as possible
so that it should work for all distributions. It is not a kernel driver like
most hardware drivers it runs in user mode as a PTY/TTY pair.

This means it works as a filter between the communications software and the
hardware.

The installer program must be run once, to initialize the devices. After that
the polydriver program runs as a daemon in the background, and sets up the
filter. It "listens" to a ttyp device, and when that device is opened by
communications software (as if it were a normal modem device) then it in turn
opens the actual serial port.

Both programs require the basis and modem licence number to be given on the
command line. These license numbers are found underneath the devices and look
like: FGBCA9AXW2CK

The driver is shipped as both source code and a compiled binary that should
work for most people.

If you want to recompile the driver yourself, do it with the "make all"
command, this is optional however.

Step 1. Installation. Simply run the installer as follows:

bin/installer -b <basis> -m <modem> -s <serial port>

An example in the typical case would look like:
bin/installer -b FGBCA9AXW2CK -m FGBCA9X6EG41 -s /dev/ttyS0

/dev/ttyS0 is the serial device corresponding to COM1. For a modem connected
to COM2 the correct serial device would be /dev/ttyS1.

The full usage of installer is as follows:
usage: bin/installer -m modem -b basis [-s serial_port] [-h] [-d] [-i]

Mandatory flags:
-b, --basis             Specify basis license number. Example: --basis FGBCA953587A.
-m, --modem             Specify modem license number. Example: --modem FGBCA96B36ZC.

Optional flags:
-d, --debug             Enable extra debugging output.
-i, --ignore            Ignore errors.
-h, --help              Print this usage screen.
-s, --serial            Specify the actual serial port that the PolyModem is attached to. Default: /dev/ttyS0

Step 2. Run the driver:

To run the driver one runs the polydriver program as follows:

bin/polydriver -b <basis> -m <modem> -s <serial port>

An example in the typical case would look like:
bin/polydriver -b FGBCA9AXW2CK -m FGBCA9X6EG41 -s /dev/ttyS0

The full usage of polydriver is as follows:
usage: bin/polydriver -m modem -b basis [-s serial_port] [-h] [-p pty_name] [-f] [-d]

Mandatory flags:
-b, --basis             Specify basis license number. Example: --basis FGBCA953587A.
-m, --modem             Specify modem license number. Example: --modem FGBCA96B36ZC.

Optional flags:
-d, --debug             Debug mode.
-f, --foreground        Don't become a daemon, stay in foreground attached to the terminal.
-h, --help              Print this usage screen.
-p, --pty               Specify the pty file name to try. Default: /dev/ptyp1.
-s, --serial            Specify the actual serial port that the PolyModem is attached to. Default: /dev/ttyS0

Two further optional steps include making a symlink from /dev/modem (which is
the device that most communications software treats as the modem by default)
to the actual ttyp that the driver listens on.

Optional: ln -s /dev/ttyp1 /dev/modem

This way communications software such as minicom or PPP can simply open the
/dev/modem device as if it were a normal modem.

After restarting your PC, the driver will not automatically restart. Most
people will want to ensure that polydriver is started automatically upon
system startup. How that happens is distribution dependant and cannont be
described here. Please refer to your distribution documentation for
information on starting polydriver with the system startup scripts.
