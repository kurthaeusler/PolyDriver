Version 0.0.3

* Fixed major bug in the installer, the modem and basis can actually talk to
each other now.

Version 0.0.2

* Improved display output by supressing chars above 126 but I notice theres
still some funny things there like exta 0s and longer numbers.

* Added a facility to log various error conditions when reading from the modem
