Sometimes the whole thing just pauses up, and theres no powerline activity,
for up to a few seconds, even during downloads.

MANY of the 4 byte headers it reads, arent headers, but actual data. It passes
them on, which works, but the windows version, when reading a 4 byte header,
gets only 4 byte headers. Thus reading 4 bytes, and not getting a header, is
considered a bug.

Sometimes PPP expects <lf> after CONNECT but never gets it.

There are situations where polydriver then pppd crashes. This is related to:
polydriver: ../sysdeps/generic/printf_fphex.c:163: __printf_fphex: Assertion `*decimal != '\0' && decimalwc != L'\0'' failed.
Aborted
when in the display function. Some invalid value being passed that cant be
converted to a hex representation. Maybe an signed char vs unsigned char issue
or something looking like a 0 in one representation but not in another..
